# Unification-Algorithm
***Predicate Calculus***

AI unification algorithm unifies two functions that are equal. The unification is done with occurs check.

Note: Variables are in UpperCase and function symboles are in lower case

Example of Unifiable functions...

g(U,V), g(f(x), y)
**solution**
U --> f(x)
V --> y
